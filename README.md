# MasterListAPP
My list application / geo / alarm 

This application was compiled in androidStudio.

Description:
Geo Location Extended task list, ordered by groups.  For each task or group of tasks, user can input any given number of time based alarms, or set up a single location geo-fence.  Upon Selection of fence location, user chooses to apply notifications when entering or leaving the area of the fence (single distance of 500m from center is defaulted).  This enables users to be notified, for example, when they leave their house that they need to do ___ .  Or when they get to someplace, like a friends house, that they need to tell them Y. .. etc..

It's kind of ugly, but I wanted to experiment a little with geo-fencing and the google API's for maps and location autocomplete.  I'm working on a better looking version as I have time.
